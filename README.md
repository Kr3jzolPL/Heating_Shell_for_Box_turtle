# Heating-Shell-for-Box-turtle
Controllable heater for box turtle enclosure using your printer with macros for automatic maintaining humidity or drying your filament 

NOT SUITABLE FOR 230V TOO DANGEROUS IF WIRED BADLY !!!!!!!!!

I used bigger wires for future proof, you might get away only with Microfit 4 pin but i highly recommend to use 18 AWG cable for this setup
i don't recommend to use multiple heating units with that config
